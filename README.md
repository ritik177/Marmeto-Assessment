<h1>Marmeto Frontend Coding Assessment - Level 2</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This project is a frontend implementation for a product detail page based on data fetched from a Shopify API. The HTML file provides a structured layout, and the JavaScript file fetches and processes data to dynamically update the product details, images, color options, and sizes.
