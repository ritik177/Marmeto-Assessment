Marmeto Frontend Coding Assessment - Level 2

This project is a frontend implementation for a product detail page based on data fetched from a Shopify API. The HTML file provides a structured layout, and the JavaScript file fetches and processes data to dynamically update the product details, images, color options, and sizes. The user can interact with the interface, selecting colors and sizes, and the "Add to Cart" functionality is implemented with a responsive message display.
